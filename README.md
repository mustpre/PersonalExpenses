# expense_tracker

My first 'Flutter' project.

## Getting Started

I am developing this app through the course I followed while learning Flutter & Dart.

## The Main Page of The App

## How the application works: 
The application first asks you to enter the title, amount and date of your expenditure. Then, if your spending belongs to the current week, it fills the bar in the chart according to the weekly total spending.

## What I learned while developing this app: 
I think I learned the basics of Flutter and Dart while developing this app. Use of nested widgets, customization, specific optimizations by device, etc. I think I've grasped things like that a little bit.
