# expense_tracker

My first 'Flutter' project.

## Getting Started

I am developing this app through the course I followed while learning Flutter & Dart.

## The Main Page of The App

## How the application works: 
1) The application first asks you to enter the title, amount and date of your expenditure.

2) Then, if your spending belongs to the current week, it fills the bar in the chart according to the weekly total spending.

2.1)If you want to delete any expenditure later, you can delete the expenditure you want from the list. The application also performs the automatic removal from the chart itself.

3) It also has a button attachment that allows the chart to be displayed separately for a better view in land-space mode.

## What I learned while developing this app: 
I think I learned the basics of Flutter and Dart while developing this app. Use of nested widgets, customization, specific optimizations by device, etc. I think I've grasped things like that a little bit.

## Notes Myself

Since there are different types of widgets on the IOS side, I need to develop the applications I will develop in the future by thinking bilaterally (for both IOS and Android) from the very beginning.
